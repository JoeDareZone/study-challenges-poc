## Study Challenges PoC

This repository contains a proof-of-concept for the Study Challenges flashcard app. It's designed to support school-aged children with exam preparation by making studying more engaging and effective through interactive challenges.


## Features

- Daily Personalized Study Sessions:
Users choose their grade and subject, and the app generates a daily challenge consisting of flashcards and a quiz.
- Active Learning:
To complete the daily challenge, users must review the flashcards and achieve a minimum of 80% correct answers on the quiz.
- Gamification & Habit Formation:
Users earn XP for passing quizzes and build streaks, motivating them to return daily.
- Note: For this PoC, flashcards are sourced from an existing API. Future iterations will integrate AI-generated flashcards and a spaced repetition system (SRS) to optimize review intervals.
